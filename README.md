# My Alexandria - Goal
A place to store my notes and generate automatic revision flash cards.

This knowledge base tries to approach knowledge acquiring and retention using scientific methods for maximum utilization.
## Notes
Notes are going to follow the Zettelkasten and Generative Notes methods and will be formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

We want notes that are **highly interconnected** and that each note is **atomic** and **small**.
## Flash Cards
Flash Cards are going to be automatic generated based on the notes on the **library** folder.

The `Properties` section of each file is going to be used by the flash card generation script to manage cards status.
